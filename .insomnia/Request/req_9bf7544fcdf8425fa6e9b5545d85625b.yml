  # Download songs


  This Endpoint loads multiple songs to the Server


  Supply the Keys of the songs in the request Body like so:

  ```json

  {
  	"keys": ["YHJVMELihGc"]
  }

  ```


  As Response you an Array of the song objects like in the `/songs/list` request.


  ## Note


  Due to the Server streaming the video from Youtube and extracting the Audio to a file, this request may take a while. It is recommended to download each song on its own with the `/songs/add-song` endpoint, because the request times out after a given period of time and the download of many songs may take longer than the timeout limit.
